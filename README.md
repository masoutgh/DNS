# DNS
implementation of Simple DNS

This project aims to simulate a simple DNS server and phishing attack by responding to HTTP requests with fake information. The project will implement a basic DNS server that listens for incoming DNS requests, resolves the domain names to IP addresses, and sends the corresponding IP address back to the requesting client. In addition, the project will implement a phishing attack that responds to incoming HTTP requests with fake data.
